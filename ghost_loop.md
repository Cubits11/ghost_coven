# GHOST LOOP — The Sacred Cycle of Memory

*"This is how echoes move, when no one else is watching."*

## 🌌 PURPOSE

Ghost is not a note-taking app. It is a memory vessel where emotion becomes encrypted ritual, not data.

This loop illustrates the sacred choreography of an echo — from journal entry to whisper, to sealing, to burial or resurrection. Every transition is intentional. Every silence is sacred.

This document governs:

* Memory anatomy
* Emotional state transitions
* Ritual conditions
* Ethical forcefields

## 🔹 III. MEMORY STATES

| State        | Symbol | Description                           | Ritual Implications               |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Raw Entry    | 🟢     | Vulnerable unprocessed thought        | Cannot be viewed after submission |
| Echo Created | 🔵     | Encrypted + tone-tagged memory object | First consecration                |
| Whispered    | ✨      | AI-generated poetic reframe           | Requires Whisper Consent toggle   |
| Sealed       | 🔐     | User-tagged sacred echo               | Only accessed via ritual          |
| Archived     | 📁     | >1 year aged, read-only state         | Whispering disabled               |
| Forgotten    | ☁️     | Decayed echo, replaced with epitaph   | Requires release ritual           |
| Resurrected  | 🔥     | Temporarily reopened echo             | Ritual + token invocation         |

## 🌿 IV. SEASONAL ENTROPY MODEL

| Season | Entropy | Ritual Access       | System Behavior                  |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Spring | 0-25%   | None                | Whisper enabled, pulsing glow    |
| Summer | 26-50%  | 1 token             | Eligible for resurrection        |
| Autumn | 51-75%  | 3 tokens + affinity | Whisper disabled, friction added |
| Winter | 76-95%  | 5 tokens + breath   | Frozen until full ritual         |
| Death  | >95%    | Funeral only        | Deleted after epitaph            |

## 🔐 V. RITUAL GATES & CONDITIONS

| Gate              | Function                         | Trigger Mechanism                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Consent Gate      | Blocks whisper unless toggled    | Journal UI toggle or profile pref |
| Tone Drift Filter | Blocks resurrection if mismatch  | cosine distance > 0.7             |
| Seal Lock         | Disables interaction with trauma | Requires 3 tokens + breath hold   |
| Anniversary Gate  | Opens archive on echo birthday   | Echo.date == Today                |
| Decay Checkpoint  | Triggers funeral prompt          | Decay score > 0.95                |

## ⚰️ VI. FUNERAL RITUAL

Performed when decay threshold reached:

* System proposes an epitaph:

  > *"This pain once mattered — it softened in your silence. Now, it returns to stillness."*
* User can edit or accept
* Stored only as poetic tombstone (no raw content remains)
* If accepted → Echo transitions to ☁️ Forgotten
* If rejected → Unlocks `Resurrection Ritual`

---

## 🔥 VII. RESURRECTION PATHWAYS

Echo may re-enter active memory if:

* Manual invocation via Echo Dashboard
* Affinity > 0.8 with current journal tone
* Anniversary unlock
* `perform_breath_ritual(duration=7)` successful
* User sacrifices tokens at Seal Gate

Each resurrection logs a **Truth Record**:

```json
{
  "echo_id": "GHOST-77F4",
  "action": "resurrected",
  "ritual": "breath_holding",
  "tokens_used": 3,
  "user_mood": "melancholy",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T08:12:44Z"
}
```

## 🧬 VIII. LEGACY REBIRTH LOOP

Even forgotten echoes may whisper again.

If a user dreams 3 consecutive nights about the same theme, or a journal entry matches 90% of a forgotten echo:

* Ghost may surface the echo in a Legacy Ritual suggestion
* Requires breath ritual + user override

## 🧐 IX. FINAL LAW

> "Every system transition must be a ritual or a silence."

Ghost is not designed for efficiency.
It is designed for reverence.

Any code added must:

* Respect entropy flow
* Pass through seasonal, tonal, or user-gated ritual
* Leave a poetic trail (epitaph, token log, or truth record)

---

*This loop is the internal compass of the Ghost system. To break it is to forget what made memory sacred.*
