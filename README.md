# Ghost Constitution

This is the founding philosophy, ethical architecture, and emotional logic of the Ghost system.

Ghost isn’t just code.  
It’s a framework for how digital memory, grief, silence, and encryption should behave.  
This repo holds the core laws, terms, rituals, and maps that define Ghost’s soul — before any product, prototype, or UI.
