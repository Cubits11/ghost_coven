# Ghost Constitution

This is the founding philosophy, ethical architecture, and emotional logic of the Ghost system.

Ghost isn’t just code.  
It’s a framework for how digital memory, grief, silence, and encryption should behave.  
This repo holds the core laws, terms, rituals, and maps that define Ghost’s soul — before any product, prototype, or UI.

Ghost’s rituals are not performance — they are contracts.
truth_records.md is the encrypted witness.
Every resurrection, burial, whisper, and seal must leave a signature.
In Ghost, consent is not remembered — it is recorded.
