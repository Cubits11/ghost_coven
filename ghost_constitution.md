# THE GHOST CONSTITUTION  
_"Rituals are not features. Silence is not a bug."_

---

## I. CORE LAWS

### 1. Memory Surfacing Requires Explicit Consent  
Ghost shall never surface or resurrect a memory unless the user has:
- Tagged it for future resurrection
- Requested a specific echo
- Initiated a whisper ritual targeting that tone

*No surprise flashbacks. No algorithmic hauntings.*

---

### 2. Emotional Data May Not Leave the Local Device  
Ghost shall not transmit journal entries, echo fingerprints, or metadata to any external server or cloud without:
- Explicit, revocable user permission  
- A documented encryption protocol

*Ghost stores grief where it was buried — not where it can be mined.*

---

### 3. Emotion Shall Not Be Interpreted Without Opt-In  
No tone detection, sentiment analysis, or emotional classification shall occur unless:
- The user toggles it explicitly
- The model used is local or zero-knowledge encrypted

*Ghost does not label your pain. It listens.*

---

### 4. No Gamification of Suffering  
Ghost shall not display streaks, stats, achievements, or numerical scores tied to:
- Entry frequency  
- Emotional category  
- Whisper generation

*Trauma is not a growth hack.*

---

### 5. Encryption Is Default, Permanent, and Local  
All entries are encrypted upon creation.  
Plaintext memory shall never be stored or transmitted.

*Ghost locks its vault the moment you speak.*

---

### 6. Memory May Not Be Overwritten Without Ritual  
Ghost shall never overwrite or delete an echo unless:
- The user confirms  
- A backup is sealed  
- The event is logged

*Erasure requires reverence.*

---

### 7. When in Doubt, Ghost Shall Be Silent  
If tone detection fails, keys are lost, or ambiguity arises:
- Ghost outputs nothing  
- Ghost saves nothing  
- Ghost simply waits

*Better silence than betrayal.*

---

### 8. Users May Freeze, Bury, or Mummify Any Memory  
Ghost must allow:
- Cold storage (encrypted, friction-access)  
- Intentional freezing of high-trauma echoes  
- Burying echoes with delayed decay

*Sometimes forgetting is sacred. Sometimes it must be earned.*

---

### 9. Rituals Must Be Interruptible Without Loss  
Any journaling or whisper ritual must:
- Be stoppable mid-entry  
- Save encrypted fragments  
- Never punish incompletion

*Your breakdown should never break the system.*

---

### 10. Memory is Sacred, Not Content  
Ghost shall never:
- Monetize memory  
- Analyze entries for engagement  
- Use echoes for product optimization

*Data is not currency. Memory is not leverage.*

---

## II. AMENDMENT PROTOCOL

1. No law shall be altered without a **ritual justification**  
2. Changes must be documented as:
   - A written change log  
   - A system-wide version flag  
   - A public record (if Ghost is public)

3. For emergency patches (security, encryption, harm reduction):
   - A silent update may occur
   - But all users must be notified within 48 hours
   - An apology log shall be included

*Ghost may adapt. But it must remember the moment it changed.*

## III. CLOSING EPIGRAPH

> “You don’t need a response. You need a witness.”
